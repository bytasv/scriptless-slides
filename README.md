scriptless-slides - no Javascript, only HTML and CSS
=================

Lately we've seen a lot of slideshow implementations which uses modern CSS, HTML and bunch of Javascript code. I tried to approach it a little differently by using only HTML and CSS - NO Javascript whatsoever.

The idea came up when I read [Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions](https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) and specificly: "Write a simple slideshow page. Bonus points if it does not use JS."

Now I hope that I would get a great deal of bonus points for this kind of slideshow :)

During experiment I come up with an idea to use the same technique for making UI widgets which are 100% CSS so if you are intrigued check my work out.

CSS UI elements:
- Dropdowns
- Modal window
- Buttons:
  - Pushin button
  - Radio buttons
  - Disabled button
- Tabs
- Accordion:
  - All visible
  - Visible only one accordion item

Used tools:
- [Twitter's bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
