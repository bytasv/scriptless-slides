scriptless-slides - no Javascript, only HTML and CSS
=================

Lately we've seen a lot of slideshow implementations which uses modern CSS, HTML and bunch of Javascript code. I tried to approach it a little differently by using only HTML and CSS - NO Javascript whatsoever.

During experiment I come up with an idea to use the same technique for making UI widgets which are 100% CSS so if you are intrigued check my work out.

CSS UI elements:
- Dropdowns
- Modal window
- Buttons:
  - Pushin button
  - Radio buttons
  - Disabled button
- Tabs
- Accordion:
  - All visible
  - Visible only one accordion item
